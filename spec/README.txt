-----------ARVA-----------

A implementation can only call itself Arva, ARVA, or arva, if it conforms to the specification.

Arva is not necesarilly a programming language, but a suite of programming tools. The core of Arva is the Arva Compiler which compiles the Arva Programming Language, or ArvaLang, however calling ArvaLang simply Arva is acceptable. (arva is NEVER to be refered to as APL in order to avoid confusion with APL). Then there is the Arva Build Tool, and the Arva Package Manager.

Arva Compiler 			-- Compiles Arva Programming Language source code.
Arva Build Tool 		-- Reads the package.toml file, locates the dependencies, and links the program.
Arva Package Manager	-- Packges, downloads, and installs Arva packages.

The specification is all documents within the directory "/spec/" in the repository currently hosted at "https://github.com/dylangentile/arva.git" excluding "/spec/overview.md" and "/spec/README.txt/".
Each document of the specification describes a different part of the language, with each part grouped logically arbitrarily.

"/spec/overview.md" serves as an introduction to the language and illustrates arva in action. It links to other parts of the specification for reference.
